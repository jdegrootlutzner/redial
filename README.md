During the summer of 2018, I travelled to Cambridge to intern at the [Berkman Klein Center] for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School(http://cyber.harvard.edu/getinvolved/internships_summer). Out of the many organizations and projects at the BKC "dedicated to exploring, understanding, and shaping the way we use technology," I worked at the [Library Innovation Lab](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/). The LIbrary Innovation Lab, which is at the intersection of libraries, technology, and law, believes in actively testing out ideas by making and doing. With the guidance of my coworkers I took on the process of bringing an idea through multiple design iterations in order to create a full-functioning prototype. 

For my project, I investigated the idea of story telling and retelling. What can we learn about the spread of information through technology? How can we build empathy through the process of story telling and retelling? What started with many questions and directions, evolved into a full-functioning art piece in which I rewired a rotary phone to a Raspberry Pi and created an interactive story telling device. On this Github, you can find the code used in this hack. Please read on to see what I learned from creating this project.

Oral storytelling is powerful. From the earliest days of evolution, gathering around camp fires and sharing stories allowed our ancestors to pass on valuable information. Oral story telling is intimate. During gatherings with friends and families we sit, eat, and share stories by voice. Oral story telling is personal. When we hear the emotion behind the words it is easier to relate to someone's story.

In the Information Age there are countless mediums to preserve and pass down narratives. Often, oral story telling can be overlooked. It is outdated. We are more likely to text a friend then pick up the phone to talk to them. What are we missing out and how could I use technology to try to deal with this disconnect?

Brainstorms and prototypes of ideas, evolved into the concept of creating a rotary phone that could record and retell stories. People would come up to the phone, dial a number from 1 to 9 to listen to a unique first-person story, and then retell the story back into the phone all while maintaining the first-person perspective. Since the next person would hear the last person's story, the story would change overtime like the "telephone game." Finally, all of the iterations of the story would be viewable on a website, so that users could see how their story changed overtime. What I strongly like about my concept is the physicality of the story telling device. Much like a fireplace, people have to be physically present to hear the stories and I hoped this would create more emotional involvement as well.

To make this physical instillation, I rewired a rotary phone to a small, low-cost computer called a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has a number of "pins," as shown on the right side of the photo of the computer chip above, which allowed me to attach the wires from the phone to read input and send output. Although I have a computer science background, hardware was new to me and this process proved to be finicky and difficult.

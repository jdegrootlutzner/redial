"Korean Barbeque Story"
"I went on a couple dates with a guy from work. I liked him because he was very ambitious. But he also was very stubborn. I told him that I liked Korean barbeque so he brought me out to dinner to a Korean barbeque place. He clearly had never been before. When they brought the raw meat he decided to eat it because he thought it was steak tartare. About half way through the dinner, after I even told him that we were supposed to cook the food ourselves, he threw up all over the dinner table. The date ended and the next day at work was pretty awkward. We didn't see each other after that."
"I went out on a date with this guy from work. I told him that I liked Korean barbeque so he took me out to Korean barbeque. So it was pretty obvious that he had never been before. So when we went he started to eat the raw meat because he thought it was like steak tartare or something. But even after I told him that you are supposed to cook it, he wouldn't. So half way through the date he just threw up everywhere. Seeing him at work the next day was pretty awkward. We didn't see each other again."
"So I went on a date with a friend of mine. On the date we ordered Korean barbeque and he thought he was supposed to eat it just like that so like raw. And after that it was pretty awkward the next day at work. And we never met again."
"So I basically went with this guy to a barbeque place and there was raw meat and he started eating it. And I kept telling him that he had too cook it, but he still kept eating the meat. And yeah, I never saw him again."
